Project: 1

Your friend has sent you a text file containing n lines. He sent a secret message 
with it, which tells you the place and time where you have to go and meet him. He 
challenges you to find it out without seeing the content of the file. He has given
hints to find it. Letâ€™s surprise him by breaking the challenge with our python code.

Hints to find the secret message: 
1. The number of lines in the file tells you the meeting time.
Note: 1 <= number of lines <= 24. If the number of lines is exceeding 12, you need to 
convert it to 12 hour format. For example, 
* If the number of lines is 15, then the meeting time is 3 PM. 
* If the number of lines is 10, then the meeting time is 10 AM.
2. The word appearing for the maximum number of times tells you the meeting place.
Note: Meeting place will be a street name. For example,
* If the word Oxford appears for the maximum number of times, then meeting place is
Oxford Street.
* If the word Park appears for the maximum number of times, then meeting place is Park Street.

Sample input 1:
Cricket, a  bat-and-ball parkgame  played  between  two  teams  of  eleven park
players on a field at the parkcenter of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a 
wicket at each end, each parkcomprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The 
batting parkscores runs by striking the ball bowled at the parkwicket with the 
parkbat, while the bowling and parkfielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss  
each parkplayer  (so  they  are  "out").  Means  of parkinclude  being bowled, 
when the ball hits the parkand dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side park
the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the park. When ten park
have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams parkroles.

Sample output 1:
Meeting time: 9 AM
Meeting place: Park Street
Explanation: Number of lines is 9. The word park appears for the maximum of 15 times
