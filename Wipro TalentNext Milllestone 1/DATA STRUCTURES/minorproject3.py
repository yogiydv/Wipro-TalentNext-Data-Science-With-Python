                     #Project: 3

# You have a record of n students. Each record contains the student's name,
# and their percent marks in Math, Physics and Chemistry.
# The marks can be floating values.
# You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type.
# Student's name is the key. Marks stored in a list is the value.
# The user enters a student's name.
# Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student.

# Formula: (sum of marks) / (no of subjects)

# Sample input:
# {
#   "Krishna": [67, 68, 69],
#   "Arjun": [70, 98, 63],
#   "Malika": [52, 56, 60]
# }

# Sample output:
# Enter a name: Malika
# Average percentage mark: 56

# Explanation:
# Marks for Malika are [52, 56, 60] whose average is (52+56+60)/3 => 56
